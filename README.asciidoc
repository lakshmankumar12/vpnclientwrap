FORTINET LINUX VPN CLINET WRAPPER
=================================

What it is
----------

If you use the fortinet ssl client's linux cli program, this script wraps on top of
it, so that it incessantly runs the client after a tunnel is broken.

How I use it
~~~~~~~~~~~~

I run the fortinet ssl client in my virtual box ubuntu, in my Windows laptop. I
generally close the lid/open the lid, to which windows-8 niclely responds by sleep'ing
and waking up. However, the ssl client inside the virtual box dies and I have to 
manually fire it back. Also, sometimes the connection is flaky and the vpn gets
disconnected. This script wraps the client and re-lauches it whenever it finds it down.

This coupled with mosh/tmux keeps an always-on connectivity to my linux-host in my vpn.
The linux-host itself is another virtual box client in my office windows pc.

Pre-requisites
--------------
This needs python 2.7+
And imports the pexpect library.

Setting it up
-------------

The following inputs needs to be setup

* You windows domain name for the vpn login
* You windows login name for the vpn login
* Your local linux machine's sudo password. The client needs to be run as root.
* The absolute path to the forticlientsslvpn_cli program
* The vpn-server hostname/ip/port.

The above information needs to be input in a credentials.py which is to be
kept in the same directory as connect.py. A sample file is given in the repository
which can be simply renamed from "credentials_sample.py" to "credentials.py"

Happy Working!
